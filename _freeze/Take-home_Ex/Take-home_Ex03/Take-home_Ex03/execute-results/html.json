However, this routine was disrupted when SouthSeafood Express Corp was caught fishing illegally, causing a significant scandal in the fishing community. FishEye International, a non-profit dedicated to combating illegal fishing, is collecting and analyzing data on ship movements and shipping records to understand this disruption better. They have compiled this data into CatchNet: the Oceanus Knowledge Graph. FishEye’s analysts need assistance in creating analytical capabilities to make sense of this data and better understand local commercial fishing behavior.\n\n## Project Objectives\n\nThis study aims to use visual analytics to understand patterns of groups in the knowledge graph. This will endeavour to:\n\n-   FishEye analysts have long wanted to better understand the flow of commercially caught fish through Oceanus’s many ports. But as they were loading data into CatchNet, they discovered they had purchased the wrong port records. They wanted to get the ship off-load records, but they instead got the port-exit records (essentially trucks/trains leaving the port area). Port exit records do not include which vessel that delivered the products. Given this limitation, develop a visualization system to associate vessels with their probable cargos. Which vessels deliver which products and when? What are the seasonal trends and anomalies in the port exit records?\n-   Develop visualizations that illustrate the inappropriate behavior of SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels. How do their movement and catch contents compare to other fishing vessels? When and where did SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels perform their illegal fishing? How many different types of suspicious behaviors are observed? Use visual evidence to justify your conclusions.\n-   To support further Fisheye investigations, develop visual analytics workflows that allow you to discover other vessels engaging in behaviors similar to SouthSeafood Express Corp’s illegal activities? Provide visual evidence of the similarities.\n-   How did fishing activity change after SouthSeafood Express Corp was caught? What new behaviors in the Oceanus commercial fishing community are most suspicious and why?\n\n## Installing Packages\n\nLet's install the required packages for addressing the challenges.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\npacman::p_load(jsonlite, tidygraph, ggraph, igraph,\n               visNetwork, graphlayouts, tidyverse, sf, leaflet, plotly, gganimate,\n               gifski)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Importing the data\n\nLet's import the data given for the challenges\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmc2_data <- fromJSON(\"data/MC2.json\")\ngeog <- st_read(\"data/Oceanus Geography.geojson\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `Oceanus Geography' from data source \n  `C:\\sarthakjn1\\ISSS608-VAA\\Take-home_Ex\\Take-home_Ex03\\data\\Oceanus Geography.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 29 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: GEOMETRY\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -167.0654 ymin: 38.07452 xmax: -163.2723 ymax: 40.67775\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Data Preparation\n\nFirst we have the data from the Transponder pings.

Hence it could possibly be a suspicious illegal fishing activity carried out at Ghoti Preserve by snappersnatcher7be.\n\n-   Roachrobberdb6 has made frequent visits to Wrasse Beds and Nav C. This is a suspicious behaviour as the fish caught at Wrasse Beds isn't seeming to go to the port directly for offloading but is going to Nav C and it seems it is going to be offloaded to another vessel at Nav C. This indicates a possible transshipment hapenning at point Nav C.\n:::\n\n### Prepare data for plotting paths of vessels\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncentroids <- st_centroid(geog)\ngeog$centroid_x <- st_coordinates(centroids)[, 1]\ngeog$centroid_y <- st_coordinates(centroids)[, 2]\nmc2_vessel_mov <- mc2_ping %>%\n  left_join(geog,\n            by = c(\"source\" = \"Name\"))\nvessel_movement_sf <- mc2_vessel_mov %>%\n  filter(!is.na(centroid_x) & !is.na(centroid_y)) %>%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"centroid_x\", \"centroid_y\"), crs = 4326)\n\nvessel_movement_sf <- vessel_movement_sf %>%\n  arrange(target, time)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Investigating paths of SouthSeaFoodCorp Vessels\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Snappersnatcher7be\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\ngeog2 <- st_read(\"data/Oceanus Geography.geojson\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `Oceanus Geography' from data source \n  `C:\\sarthakjn1\\ISSS608-VAA\\Take-home_Ex\\Take-home_Ex03\\data\\Oceanus Geography.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 29 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: GEOMETRY\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -167.0654 ymin: 38.07452 xmax: -163.2723 ymax: 40.67775\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\ngeog2 <- st_centroid(geog2)\n\nvessel_trajectory <- vessel_movement_sf %>%\n  group_by(target) %>%\n  summarize(do_union = FALSE) %>%\n  st_cast(\"LINESTRING\")\nvessel_trajectory_selected <- vessel_trajectory %>%\n  filter(target == \"snappersnatcher7be\")\n\n\nggplot(data = geog2) +\n  geom_sf(data = geog2) +\n  geom_sf(data = vessel_trajectory_selected, \n          aes(color = factor(target)), \n          size = 1) +\n   geom_sf_text(aes(label = Name, geometry = geometry), size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Trajectories of snappersnacther7be\", \n  x = \"Longitude\", y = \"Latitude\", color = \"ID\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Roachrobberdb6\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nvessel_trajectory_selected <- vessel_trajectory %>%\n  filter(target == \"roachrobberdb6\")\n\n\np <- ggplot(data = geog2) +\n  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry)) +\n  geom_sf_text(aes(label = Name, geometry = geometry), size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_sf(data = vessel_trajectory_selected, \n          aes(color = factor(target)), \n          size = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Trajectories of roachrobberdb6\", \n  x = \"Longitude\", y = \"Latitude\", color = \"ID\")\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Insights:\n\n-   Roachrobberdb6 which visits Nav C and Wrasse Beds at a very high frequency suggests that these two locations should be geographically close for it to carry out possible suspicious activities.

Further insights can be obtained by looking at the network graph.\n:::\n\n### Observing anomalies in Port Offloading records\n\nPreparing the data for investigating port offloading records\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nmc2_nodes <- as_tibble(mc2_data$nodes) %>%\n  mutate(name = as.character(name),\n         id = as.character(id),\n         type = as.character(type),\n         date = as.character(as.Date(date)),\n         qty = as.character(as.double(qty_tons),\n         company = as.character(company)\n                            )) %>%\n  select(id, name, type, date, qty, company)\n\nmc2_transaction <-\n  as_tibble(mc2_data$links) %>%\n  distinct() %>%\n  mutate(source =\n           as.character(source),\n         target=\n           as.character(target),\n         type = as.character(type),\n         date = as.character(date)\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(source, target, type) %>%\n  filter((source != target) & type == 'Event.Transaction') %>%\n  select(source, target, type, date)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nmc2_deliveryreport <- mc2_nodes %>% filter(type == 'Entity.Document.DeliveryReport')\nmc2_fish <- mc2_nodes %>% filter(type == 'Entity.Commodity.Fish')\nmc2_loc <- mc2_nodes %>% filter(type == 'Entity.Location.City')\nmc2_transaction_loc <- inner_join(mc2_loc, mc2_transaction, by = c(\"id\" = \"target\"))\nmc2_transaction_fish <- inner_join(mc2_fish, mc2_transaction, by = c(\"id\" = \"target\"))\nmc2_transaction_loc <- inner_join(mc2_transaction_fish, mc2_transaction_loc, by = c(\"source\" = \"source\"))\nmc2_transaction_loc <- inner_join(mc2_transaction_loc, mc2_deliveryreport, by = c(\"source\" = \"id\"))\nmc2_transaction_loc <- mc2_transaction_loc %>%\n  mutate(suspect_arrival = as.character(as.Date(date,format = \"%Y-%m-%d\") - 1),\n         suspect_arrival2 = as.character(as.Date(date,format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")),\n         month = month(date))\n\nmc2_portoffloadtotal <- mc2_transaction_loc %>%\n  group_by(month, id.y) %>%\n  summarize(totalqty = sum(as.double(qty)),\n            totalcalls = n()) %>%\n  select(id.y, month, totalqty, totalcalls)\n\nmc2_portoffload <- mc2_transaction_loc %>%\n  group_by(month, id.y, name.x) %>%\n  summarize(totalqty = sum(as.double(qty)),\n            totalcalls = n()) %>%\n  select(id.y, name.x, month, totalqty, totalcalls)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Histogram of Cargo Offload Transactions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmc2_transaction_loc <- mc2_transaction_loc %>% mutate(qty = as.double(qty))\n# Calculate median\nmedian_value <- median(mc2_transaction_loc$qty)\n\n# Calculate Q3 and IQR\nQ3 <- quantile(mc2_transaction_loc$qty, 0.75)\nIQR <- IQR(mc2_transaction_loc$qty)\nupper_whisker <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\nggplot(mc2_transaction_loc, aes(x = as.double(qty))) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median_value), linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = upper_whisker), linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Cargo offload transactions\", x = \"Quantity\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = median_value, y = Inf, label = paste(\"Median:\", round(median_value, 2)), vjust = 1, color = \"red\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = upper_whisker, y = Inf, label = paste(\"Upper Whisker:\", round(upper_whisker, 2)), vjust = 1, color = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex03_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Insights:\n\n-   Records above the Upper Whisker of Quantity 69 tonnes need to be investigated further as they seem to be outliers.
